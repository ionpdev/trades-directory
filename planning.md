### 💡 **Architecture & Stack**

- **Next.js (App Router)**: Best modern choice for React apps — allows routing, layouts, and server components if needed.
- **TypeScript**: Mandatory for maintainability and type safety in a team environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Great for rapid UI development and aligns with modern frontend stacks.
- **Apollo Client (GraphQL)**: Ideal for mimicking how Checkatrade likely manages their real data. Offers cache, devtools, and strong TypeScript integration.
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: 👏 Perfect call.
  - Mock GraphQL endpoints or REST APIs
  - Works with both unit tests and dev environments
  - Makes your app feel "real" with zero backend dependency

## 🔁 Flow Coverage with Mocking

### 🧑 Visitor Flow — **Fully Mockable**

| Feature        | How to Mock                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Search Page    | Return a static list of tradespeople based on trade/postcode |
| Ratings/Badges | Include ratings and badge fields in mock GraphQL             |
| Detail Page    | Provide full mocked profile info via GraphQL mock            |
| Performance    | MSW responds instantly, feels like a real API                |

### 🔐 Logged-in User Flow — **Also Mockable**

| Feature        | How to Mock                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Login/Register | Store mock auth state in a React context or next-auth with mock adapter |
| Leave a Review | Persist to local state or `localStorage`                                |
| Favourites     | Mocked GraphQL mutation and query for favourites, store locally         |

Mocking lets you showcase _working flows_ without backend complexity.

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

| Layer          | Tool                         | MSW Support?                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Tests** | Jest + React Testing Library | ✅ Yes (Node mode)                       |
| **E2E Tests**  | Cypress                      | ✅ Yes (runs with MSW active in browser) |
| **Storybook**  | Storybook                    | ✅ Yes (with MSW addon or decorators)    |

You can even show off Storybook with mocked GraphQL data, making your components previewable in isolation.

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

Even with mocks:

- App can be deployed on **Vercel**
- Use **GitHub Actions** for CI (test, lint, build)
- Future extension: point Apollo to real GCP GraphQL API by swapping base URL/env
